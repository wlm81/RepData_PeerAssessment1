## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r processfile, echo=TRUE}
        activityData <- read.csv(unzip(zipfile='activity.zip'))
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r dailyMean, echo=TRUE}
        library(ggplot2)
        stepDailyMean <- tapply(activityData$steps, activityData$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
        hist(stepDailyMean, col='green', xlab='Total Number of Steps Each Day')
        dailyMean <- mean(stepDailyMean, na.rm = TRUE)
        dailyMedian <- median(stepDailyMean, na.rm = TRUE)
```
The mean is r dailyMean and the median is r dailyMedian.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r dailyPattern, echo=TRUE}
        
'''

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
